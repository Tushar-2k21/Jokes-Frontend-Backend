# Project Setup

## Running the Application

Follow the steps below to set up and run both the backend and frontend of the application.

### Step 1: Open Integrated Terminals
You'll need two integrated terminalsâ€”one for the backend and one for the frontend.

#### Backend Setup:
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2. Install the dependencies and start the backend server:
    ```bash
    npm install    # Install dependencies
    npm run start  # Start the backend server
    ```

#### Frontend Setup:
1. Open a second terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2. Install the dependencies and start the frontend development server:
    ```bash
    npm install    # Install dependencies
    npm run dev    # Start the frontend development server
    ```

### Step 2: Access the Application
- Once both servers are running, the frontend will typically be available at `http://localhost:5173`, and the backend will be running at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if configured).
